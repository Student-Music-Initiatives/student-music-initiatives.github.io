<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    Conceived in 2011 and officially incorporated in 2013, SMI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is completely student-run and student-led. We strive to give opportunities for aspiring individuals to contribute to their community through making music, marketing to the public, handling donations, and more! Over the years, we've connected countless communities together through the universal language and power of music.
</p>

<p>
    Our mission is to provide a platform for students to express themselves through music and to give back to the community. We aim to foster a sense of community and togetherness through music, and to provide a space for students to grow and develop their skills. We are thankful for the support of our community and are excited to continue to grow and expand our reach.
