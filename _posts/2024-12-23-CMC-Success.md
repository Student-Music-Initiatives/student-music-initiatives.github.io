Thank you everyone who volunteered and stopped by during our final stretch! We absolutely annihilated our $3000 goal for the American Cancer Society, raising more money this CMC than any other on record, and more money than the entirety of all the events last year.

Total raised: $4733.55

- Day 1: $806.99
- Day 2: $533.38
- Day 3: $613.00
- Day 4: $793.46
- Day 5: $1184.98
- Day 6: $801.74

We had musicians and donation handlers from Inglemoor, Bothell, North Creek, Mariner, Juanita, and more participate, as well as thousands pass by our performances. Lots of new faces and familiar alumni!

Have a pleasant winter break and a merry Christmas!
